Download the folders Batasm for the language and the samantic tokens and download Batasm-syntax for out of the box syntax highlighing.

Locate your Vscode folder topically "C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code"
Open the extention folder ".../Microsoft VS Code\resources\app\extensions"
add the Batasm to the extensions folder and Batasm-syntax if you want the syntax highlighting from the box.

Open Vscode and make a new .as file
Click the bottom right "Plain text" and change it to Batasm, by either scrolling or searching for it
if you do not see Batasm, close and reopen Vscode

If you used the Batasm-syntax folder, go to the gear bottom left (settings) and select Themes>Colour Themes
Find "Batasm highlighting" by scrolling or searching, click on it and the theme will change, now any .as Batasm file will have syntax highlighting
